# AWS Control Tower Demo & Overview

## What is AWS Control Tower?

**AWS Control Tower** is a service that helps set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices. It automates the setup of a landing zone and provides governance using **guardrails**, **account provisioning**, and **centralized logging**.

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to set up AWS Control Tower via the AWS Console and compares it to manually managing AWS accounts.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console using the root account.
2. Navigate to **Control Tower** from the Services menu or search bar.

### Step 2: Configure Organizational Units (OUs)

1. Create Foundational OU (default name `Security`).
2. Create Additional OUs if needed (e.g., `Enviroments`, this can be created later).

### Step 3: Configure shared accounts

1. Configure Log Archive account. (immutable logs of API activities and resource changes from all accounts.)
2. Configure Audit account. (centralized account for security and compliance audits.)

Note: These accounts are created automatically and used for centralized logging and governance under Security OU.

1. Choose an **SSO option** or AWS IAM Identity Center configuration. 
2. Configure trail and config settings for centralized logging. 
3. Review **Account Factory** settings for provisioning new accounts. 
4. Review and set up **guardrails** (predefined security and compliance controls).

### Step 5: Review and Set Up Landing Zone

2. Click **Set up landing zone**.
3. The provisioning process takes approximately 30‚Äì60 minutes.

## Conclusion
AWS Control Tower is a powerful service for quickly establishing a secure, multi-account AWS environment with built-in governance. 
It is ideal for organizations looking to enforce best practices and streamline account management. 
However, for highly customized setups or when using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, manual management may provide the flexibility needed.
